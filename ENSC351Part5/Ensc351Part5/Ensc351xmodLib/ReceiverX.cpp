/* Only called after an SOH character has been received and
posted to the Receiver_SS statechart. The function tries
to receive the remaining characters to form a complete
block.  The member
variable goodBlk1st will be made true if this is the first
time that the block was received in "good" condition.
 The function will set or reset a Boolean variable,
goodBlk. This variable will be made false if either
	� the needed number of bytes have not yet been received and another
	byte does not arrive within the character timeout since the last byte
	(or within the character timeout of the function being called).
	� the needed number of bytes (or more) are received and the block
	created using the needed number of bytes has something
	wrong with it, like the checksum being incorrect.
	� more than the needed number of bytes are received.
The function will also set or reset another Boolean variable,
syncLoss. syncLoss will only be set to true when there is a
fatal loss of syncronization as described in the XMODEM
specification. If goodBlk has not already been made false
and if syncLoss is false, then goodBlk will be set to true.  The
first time each block is received and is good, goodBlk1st will be
set to true.  This is an indication of when a block should be
written to disk.  If goodBlk is false and at
least the needed number of bytes were received in the function,
then a purge() function should be called before returning from
getRestBlk(). The purge() subroutine will read and discard
characters until nothing is received over a character timeout period.
